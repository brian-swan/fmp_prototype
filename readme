This is a project created using Claude 3.7 Sonnet. All code was generated by Claude. Several iterations were necessary, but this was the initial prompt:

I would like to build a prototype for a Feature Management Platform (FMP). The most important component of the platform is an API that can be called from applications to read the value of a feature flag. Can you help me design and build such a platform?
